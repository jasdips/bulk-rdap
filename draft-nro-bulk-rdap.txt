Abstract

   To complement the move from Whois to RDAP for the RIRs (Regional
   Internet Registries), this document specifies a new service, named
   Bulk RDAP, that an RIR can deploy in lieu of their Bulk Whois
   service.

1.  Introduction

   As the RIRs shift from Whois to RDAP, they also need an RDAP
   replacement for their Bulk Whois service.  To that end, this document
   specifies a new service, named Bulk RDAP, that an RIR can deploy in
   lieu of Bulk Whois.  This service is intended to be a simple, easy-
   to-implement replacement for Bulk Whois.

   At a higher level, Bulk RDAP comprises JSON data for IP Network,
   Autonomous System Number, Domain, Nameserver, and Entity object
   classes (Section 5 of [RFC9083]), plus some JSON metadata.  It can be
   easily extended to include data for any future RDAP object class.
   Furthermore, it is an HTTPS-based service that the RIR customers
   could use to securely get this data.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Indentation and whitespace in examples are provided only to
   illustrate element relationships, and are not a REQUIRED feature of
   this service.

   "..." in examples is used as shorthand for elements defined outside
   of this document.

2.  Data Format

   The Bulk RDAP data is a JSON object comprising JSON members for
   metadata and JSON data for RDAP object classes.

2.1.  Metadata

   The following JSON members for metadata MUST be included:

   *  "rdapConformance" -- An array of strings (Section 4.1 of
      [RFC9083]) to signal the RDAP extensions the data is based on.
   *  "serial" -- An unsigned 32-bit number for sequencing the data
      snapshots.  It is RECOMMENDED to follow the serial number-wrapping
      arithmetic from [RFC1982].

2.2.  Data For Object Classes

   The JSON data for RDAP object classes is an "objects" member -- a
   JSON array comprising all the objects for one or more RDAP object
   classes.  It is RECOMMENDED that an RIR provide bulk data for IP
   Network, Autonomous System Number, Domain, Nameserver, and Entity
   object classes (Section 5 of [RFC9083]).

   Furthermore, within the JSON array:

   *  The "self" links for each primary object and the secondary objects
      it contains MUST be included to have parity with the "ref" element
      in Bulk Whois.
   *  For compactness, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to include details for a
      secondary object beside its "self" link, "handle" when defined,
      and relationship to the primary object (e.g., using the "roles"
      member in an Entity object to relate to an IP Network object).
   *  An "rdapConformance" member MAY be included at the top of a
      primary object if the RDAP extensions used to produce it are
      different from those listed in the "rdapConformance" member for
      metadata.

2.3.  Example

   Here is an elided example of a JSON object containing bulk data for
   both IP Network and Autonomous System Number object classes:

           ...
         ],
       },
       ...
     ]
   }

3.  Extension Identifier

   The "nroBulkRdap1" extension identifier (see Section 7.1) MUST be
   included in the top-level "rdapConformance" member of the JSON object
   for bulk data, to signal adherence to this specification.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the extension identifier for the NRO RDAP
   Profile ("nro_rdap_profile_0") also be included in the top-level
   "rdapConformance" member.  But, when in conflict, the Bulk RDAP
   extension requirements SHOULD supersede the NRO RDAP Profile
   extension requirements, primarily to afford bulk data compactness.

4.  Bulk Data URL




                         Expires 1 November 2024                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  bulk-rdap                     April 2024


   *  Scheme: HTTPS
   *  Method: GET
   *  Path Segment: nroBulkRdap1?objectClasses=<comma-separated string
      of RDAP object class names>
   *  Returns: Bulk data as either JSON data (Section 2) or JSON Web
      Signature (JWS) string (Section 5)
   *  Content-Type: application/rdap+json

   Using comma (',') to delimit multiple object class names for the
   value of the "objectClasses" query parameter assumes that there will
   be no comma in future RDAP object class names.

   Here is an example URL to get bulk data for IP Network, Autonomous
   System Number, and Entity object classes:

https://example.net/nroBulkRdap1?objectClasses=ip%20network,autnum,entity

   For a 200 OK response (Section 15.3.1 of [RFC9110]), the server MUST
   return a JSON object with its "objects" member filled with all the
   objects for the RDAP object classes listed in the "objectClasses"
   query parameter.

   If the RDAP object classes listed in the "objectClasses" query
   parameter are all valid (Section 5 of [RFC9083], or a future RDAP
   object class) but the bulk data functionality has not been
   implemented for some of them, the server SHOULD return a 501 Not
   Implemented response (Section 15.6.2 of [RFC9110]).

   If one or more of the RDAP object classes listed in the
   "objectClasses" query parameter are invalid, the server SHOULD return
   a 400 Bad Request response (Section 15.5.1 of [RFC9110]).

5.  Security Considerations

   It is RECOMMENDED that JSON Web Signature (JWS) [RFC7515] and JSON
   Web Key (JWK) [RFC7517] be used to sign and validate JSON data for
   Bulk RDAP.  It is further RECOMMENDED that Elliptic Curve Digital
   Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) (Section 3.4 of [RFC7518]) be used for
   JWS.

   When JWS and JWK are used to sign JSON data, the JWS string is
   returned in the HTTP response for the bulk data call.  The client
   first verifies the JWS string and then decodes the Base64URL-encoded
   payload for JSON data.

   Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that the guidance from Section 3 of
   [RFC7481] be followed to secure the bulk data URL for encryption,
   authentication, and authorization.

6.  Operational Considerations

   It is NOT RECOMMENDED to make the RDAP bulk data available over FTP
   ([RFC959]).  Compared to HTTPS, FTP is generally considered more
   complex to operate, less secure, and less firewall-friendly.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  RDAP Extensions Registry

   IANA is requested to register the following value in the RDAP
   Extensions Registry at https://www.iana.org/assignments/rdap-
   extensions/: (https://www.iana.org/assignments/rdap-extensions/:)

   *  Extension identifier: nroBulkRdap1
   *  Registry operator: Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), including
      at national and local levels.
   *  Published specification: This document.
   *  Contact: Number Resource Organization (NRO) secretariat@nro.net
      (mailto:secretariat@nro.net)
   *  Intended usage: This NRO-level extension describes version 1 of a
      method to access registration data in bulk from the RIRs through
      RDAP.

   proposal ([I-D.harrison-regext-rdap-mirroring]), especially for the

Appendix A.  Other Potential Use Cases

   Though this specification is intended to provide access to bulk data
   from the RIRs through RDAP, it may also be used for the following
   potential use cases:

   *  Escrow: Although there is presently no requirement for the RIRs to
      escrow their registration data, the JSON data format described
      here could be used for that purpose in the future.

Internet-Draft                  bulk-rdap                     April 2024


   *  Resource utilization data upload to an RDAP server: The RIR
      customers are typically required to report back on the utilization
      of their allocated IP addresses and autonomous system numbers to
      the RIR.  A customer could locally run an RDAP server and upload
      the utilization data for its number resources in the form of RDAP
      objects.  The JSON data format described here could be used for
      periodically uploading such data to a local RDAP server.
