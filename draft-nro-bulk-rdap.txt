Abstract

   To complement the move from Whois to RDAP for the RIRs (Regional

1.  Introduction

   As the RIRs shift from Whois to RDAP, they also need an RDAP
   replacement for their Bulk Whois service.  To that end, this document
   specifies a new service named the Bulk RDAP that an RIR can deploy in
   lieu of the Bulk Whois.  This service is intended to be a simple,
   easy-to-implement replacement for the Bulk Whois.

   At a higher level, the Bulk RDAP comprises JSON data for IP Network,
   Autonomous System Number, Domain, Nameserver, and Entity object
   classes (Section 5 of [RFC9083]), plus some JSON metadata.  It can be
   easily extended to include data for any future RDAP object class.
   Furthermore, it is an HTTPS-based service that the RIR customers
   could use to securely get this data.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Indentation and whitespace in examples are provided only to
   illustrate element relationships, and are not a REQUIRED feature of
   this service.

   "..." in examples is used as shorthand for elements defined outside
   of this document.

2.  Bulk Data Format

   The data returned for a Bulk RDAP request (Section 4) is a JSON
   object comprising JSON members for metadata and JSON data for a
   single RDAP object class.

2.1.  Metadata

   The following JSON members for metadata MUST be included:

   *  "rdapConformance" -- An array of strings (Section 4.1 of
      [RFC9083]) to signal the RDAP extensions the data is based on.
   *  "serial" -- An unsigned 32-bit number for sequencing the data
      snapshots.  It is RECOMMENDED to follow the serial number-wrapping
      arithmetic from [RFC1982].

2.2.  Data for an Object Class

   The JSON data for an RDAP object class is an "objects" member -- a
   JSON array comprising all the objects for that class.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that an RIR provide bulk data for IP Network, Autonomous
   System Number, Domain, Nameserver, and Entity object classes
   (Section 5 of [RFC9083]).

   Furthermore, within the JSON array:

   *  The "self" links for each primary object and the secondary objects
      it contains MUST be included to have parity with the "ref" element
      in the Bulk Whois.
   *  For compactness, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to include details for a
      secondary object beside its "self" link, "handle" when defined,
      and relationship to the primary object (e.g., using the "roles"
      member in an Entity object to relate to an IP Network object).
   *  An "rdapConformance" member MAY be included at the top of a
      primary object if the RDAP extensions used to produce it are
      different from those listed in the "rdapConformance" member for
      metadata.

2.3.  Example

   Here is an elided example of a JSON object containing bulk data for
   the IP Network object class:

3.  Extension Identifier

   The "nroBulkRdap1" extension identifier (see Section 7.1) MUST be
   included in the top-level "rdapConformance" member of the JSON object
   for bulk data, to signal adherence to this specification.





                         Expires 1 November 2024                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  bulk-rdap                     April 2024


   It is RECOMMENDED that the extension identifier for the NRO RDAP
   Profile ("nro_rdap_profile_0") also be included in the top-level
   "rdapConformance" member.  But, when in conflict, the Bulk RDAP
   extension requirements SHOULD supersede the NRO RDAP Profile
   extension requirements, primarily to afford bulk data compactness.

4.  Bulk RDAP URL

   *  Scheme: HTTPS
   *  Method: GET
   *  Path Segment: nroBulkRdap1?objectClass=<RDAP object class name>
   *  Returns: Bulk data as either JSON data (Section 2) or JSON Web
      Signature (JWS) string (Section 5)
   *  Content-Type: application/rdap+json

   Limiting the query to a single RDAP object class in the Bulk RDAP URL
   should result in a simpler service implementation, as well as better
   performance when serving requests.

   Here is an example URL to get bulk data for the IP Network object
   class:

   https://example.net/nroBulkRdap1?objectClass=ip%20network

   _Figure 2_

   For a 200 OK response (Section 15.3.1 of [RFC9110]), the server MUST
   return a JSON object with its "objects" member filled with all the
   objects for the RDAP object class listed in the "objectClass" query
   parameter.

   If the RDAP object class listed in the "objectClass" query parameter
   is valid (Section 5 of [RFC9083], or a future RDAP object class) but
   the bulk data functionality has not been implemented for it, the
   server SHOULD return a 501 Not Implemented response (Section 15.6.2
   of [RFC9110]).

   If the RDAP object class listed in the "objectClass" query parameter
   is invalid, the server SHOULD return a 400 Bad Request response
   (Section 15.5.1 of [RFC9110]).

5.  Security Considerations

   It is RECOMMENDED that JSON Web Signature (JWS) [RFC7515] and JSON
   Web Key (JWK) [RFC7517] be used to sign and validate JSON data for
   the Bulk RDAP.  It is further RECOMMENDED that Elliptic Curve Digital
   Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) (Section 3.4 of [RFC7518]) be used for
   JWS.

Internet-Draft                  bulk-rdap                     April 2024


   When the server uses JWS and JWK to sign JSON data, a JWS string is
   returned in the HTTP response for a Bulk RDAP request.  The client
   then verifies the JWS string before decoding the Base64URL-encoded
   payload for JSON data.

   Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that the guidance from Section 3 of
   [RFC7481] be followed to secure the Bulk RDAP URL for encryption,
   authentication, and authorization.

6.  Operational Considerations

   It is NOT RECOMMENDED to make the RDAP bulk data available over FTP
   ([RFC959]).  Compared to HTTPS, FTP is generally considered more
   complex to operate, less secure, and less firewall-friendly.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  RDAP Extensions Registry

   IANA is requested to register the following value in the RDAP
   Extensions Registry at https://www.iana.org/assignments/rdap-
   extensions/: (https://www.iana.org/assignments/rdap-extensions/:)

   *  Extension identifier: nroBulkRdap1
   *  Registry operator: Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), including
      at national and local levels.
   *  Published specification: This document.
   *  Contact: Number Resource Organization (NRO) secretariat@nro.net
      (mailto:secretariat@nro.net)
   *  Intended usage: This NRO-level extension describes version 1 of a
      method to access registration data in bulk from the RIRs through
      RDAP.

   proposal ([I-D.harrison-regext-rdap-mirroring]), especially for the
   serial number and JSON Web Signature ideas.

Appendix A.  Other Potential Use Cases

A.1.  Escrow

   Although there is presently no requirement for the RIRs to escrow
   their registration data, the JSON data format described here could be
   used for that purpose in the future.
