Abstract

   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) is used by Regional
   Internet Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs) to
   provide access to their resource registration information.  For the
   corresponding Whois service, RIRs generally publish the information
   in bulk format, for use cases where the standard query service is not
   suitable.  This document defines a similar bulk service for use with
   RDAP.

1.  Introduction

   As the RIRs shift from Whois to RDAP, they also need an RDAP
   counterpart for their Bulk Whois service.  To that end, this document
   specifies a new service, named the Bulk RDAP, that an RIR can deploy
   to provide access to RDAP data in bulk format.

Internet-Draft                  bulk-rdap                       May 2024


   At a higher level, the Bulk RDAP comprises JSON data for IP Network,
   Autonomous System Number, Domain, Nameserver, and Entity object
   classes (Section 5 of [RFC9083]), plus some JSON metadata.  It can be
   easily extended to include data for any future RDAP object class.
   Furthermore, it is an HTTPS-based service that the RIR customers can
   use to securely get this bulk data.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Indentation and whitespace in examples are provided only to
   illustrate element relationships, and are not a REQUIRED feature of
   this service.

   "..." in examples is used as shorthand for elements defined outside
   of this document.

2.  Bulk Data Format

   The data returned for a Bulk RDAP request (Section 4) is a JSON Text
   Sequence ([RFC7464]) of JSON objects, with each object prefixed by an
   ASCII Record Separator character (0x1E) and ending with an ASCII Line
   Feed character (0x0A).  The first object in the returned sequence
   provides the metadata information for the bulk data, and the
   following objects are data objects for one or more RDAP object
   classes (Section 5 of [RFC9083]).  This data format should make bulk
   data streaming computationally efficient for the clients.

2.1.  Metadata

   The metadata JSON object MUST include the following members:

   *  "rdapConformance" -- an array of strings representing a union of
      all the RDAP extension identifiers used in the construction of the
      bulk data response; note that this is a loose interpretation of
      (Section 4.1 of [RFC9083])
   *  "versionId" -- a version 4 Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID,
      Section 5.4 of [RFC9562]) string that MUST be the same for bulk
      data that was generated by the producer at a given time, such that
      if multiple bulk files with the same "versionId" are combined, the
      result is consistent as among its records

Internet-Draft                  bulk-rdap                       May 2024


   *  "producer" -- a string identifying the registry that produced the
      bulk data, with possible values of "AFRINIC", "APNIC", "ARIN",
      "LACNIC", "RIPE NCC", or an agreed-upon string literal for a
      registry at the national or local level
   *  "productionDate" -- a string containing the date and time in Zulu
      (Z) format with UTC offset of 00:00 ([RFC3339]), indicating the
      time at which the dump/snapshot was taken from the database, even
      if empty; for example, "2024-05-23T19:30:32Z"
   *  "objectCount" -- a number greater than or equal to zero,
      representing the count of data objects following the metadata
      object, to help clients detect a partial response for a bulk data
      request; zero count is possible when an RDAP object class is
      supported but no data exists

2.2.  Data

   The metadata object is followed by data objects for one or more RDAP
   object classes.  Beside adhering to the object class definition per
   Section 5 of [RFC9083] or the specification of a future RDAP object
   class, each returned object has the following requirements:

   *  An "rdapConformance" member (Section 4.1 of [RFC9083]) MUST be
      included to indicate the RDAP extensions used for constructing the
      object.  Note that this is a loose interpretation of (Section 4.1
      of [RFC9083]).
   *  For data compactness, the object MUST include only its first-level
      nested objects and no more.  For example, an entity object
      (representing an organization) can contain IP network and
      autonomous system number objects but not the entity objects for
      those IP network and autonomous system number objects.
   *  The "self" links (Section 4.2 of [RFC9083]) for the object and its
      first-level nested objects MUST be included.  For example, include
      the "self" links for an entity object (representing an
      organization) and its IP network and autonomous system number
      objects.
   *  For further data compactness, a first-level nested object MUST NOT
      include any other data beside its "self" link, "handle"
      (representing a registry-unique identifier for the object) if
      defined, and relationship to the containing object if defined (for
      example, using the "roles" member in a nested entity object to
      relate to its containing IP network object).

3.  Extension Identifier

   When a bulk data response originates from an RIR, the "nroBulkRdap1"
   extension identifier for this specification (see Section 7.1) MUST be
   included in the "rdapConformance" member of the metadata object, and
   in the "rdapConformance" member of each data object.  This
   requirement also applies to a national or local registry.

   The clients which host the downloaded bulk data MUST omit the
   "nroBulkRdap1" extension identifier when including data objects in
   responses for non-bulk contexts.

   If a registry has implemented the NRO RDAP Profile
   (https://bitbucket.org/nroecg/nro-rdap-profile/raw/v1/nro-rdap-
   profile.txt), the extension identifier "nro_rdap_profile_0" MUST be
   included in the "rdapConformance" member of the metadata object, and
   in the "rdapConformance" member of each data object.

   If both the Bulk RDAP and NRO RDAP Profile extensions are used when
   constructing a bulk data response, the Bulk RDAP extension
   requirements MUST take precedence over the NRO RDAP Profile
   requirements for data objects; primarily to afford bulk data
   compactness.

4.  Bulk RDAP URL

   *  Scheme: HTTPS
   *  Method: GET
   *  Path Segment: nroBulkRdap1?objectClass=<RDAP object class name>
   *  Returns: See Section 4.1 and Section 4.2

   The HTTPS scheme MUST be used for the Bulk RDAP URL.

   When the "objectClass" query parameter is present in the request URL,
   the bulk data response MUST be limited to all the objects for the
   RDAP object class listed in that query parameter.

   When the "objectClass" query parameter is absent in the request URL,
   the bulk data response MUST return all the objects for all the RDAP
   object classes the server supports.

   The following is an example URL to get bulk data for the IP Network
   object class:

   https://example.net/nroBulkRdap1?objectClass=ip%20network

   If the RDAP object class listed in the "objectClass" query parameter
   is valid (Section 5 of [RFC9083] or a future RDAP object class) but
   the bulk data functionality has not been implemented for it, the
   server SHOULD return a 501 Not Implemented response (Section 15.6.2
   of [RFC9110]).

   If the RDAP object class listed in the "objectClass" query parameter
   is invalid, the server SHOULD return a 400 Bad Request response
   (Section 15.5.1 of [RFC9110]).

   The following is an example URL to get bulk data for all the RDAP
   object classes an RIR supports:

   https://example.net/nroBulkRdap1

4.1.  Content Type

   The Content-Type header (Section 8.3 of [RFC9110]) in a bulk data
   response MUST be set to one of the following:

   *  "application/json-seq" -- for a JSON Text Sequence ([RFC7464]) of
      metadata JSON object and RDAP objects
   *  "application/jose" -- for JWS compact serialization (Section 3.1
      of [RFC7515]) of the metadata and data objects (see Section 5)
   *  "application/json" -- for JWS JSON serialization (Section 3.2 of
      [RFC7515]) of the metadata and data objects (see Section 5)

4.2.  Content Encoding

   Since the bulk data responses are likely to be large, servers and
   clients are RECOMMENDED to set the Content-Encoding header
   (Section 8.4 of [RFC9110]) to "gzip" in order to reduce the amount of
   data that is transmitted.

   Depending on the headers set by the client, the server may not be
   able to do this compression, in which case it could opt to fall back
   to an uncompressed response, or return a 406 Not Acceptable response
   (Section 15.5.7 of [RFC9110]), effectively requiring the client to
   support gzip.

5.  Security Considerations

   It is RECOMMENDED that JSON Web Signature (JWS) [RFC7515] and JSON
   Web Key (JWK) [RFC7517] be used to sign and validate the JSON data
   returned for a Bulk RDAP response.  It is further RECOMMENDED that
   Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) (Section 3.4 of
   [RFC7518]) be used for JWS.

   Furthermore, the guidance from Section 3 of [RFC7481] MUST be
   followed to secure the Bulk RDAP URL for authentication,
   authorization, and encryption.

6.  Operational Considerations

   If a server uses the JWS to secure bulk data, the related JWK is
   assumed to be distributed out-of-band to the clients.

   Since bulk data generation and optionally signing it are considered
   computationally expensive, it is RECOMMENDED that these operations be
   performed off-line and once a day.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  RDAP Extensions Registry

   IANA is requested to register the following value in the RDAP
   Extensions Registry at https://www.iana.org/assignments/rdap-
   extensions/: (https://www.iana.org/assignments/rdap-extensions/:)

   *  Extension identifier: nroBulkRdap1
   *  Registry operator: Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), including
      at national and local levels.
   *  Published specification: This document.
   *  Contact: Number Resource Organization (NRO) secretariat@nro.net
      (mailto:secretariat@nro.net)
   *  Intended usage: This NRO-level extension describes version 1 of a
      method to access registration data in bulk from the RIRs through
      RDAP.

8.  Acknowledgements

   The JSON Web Signature idea is borrowed from the RDAP Mirroring
   Protocol proposal ([I-D.harrison-regext-rdap-mirroring]).  In the
   metadata object, using a UUID for the "versionId" field is influenced
   by the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP, [RFC8182]), and the
   "producer" and "productionDate" fields by the NRO Transfer Log Format
   (https://github.com/nro-ecg/transfer_log/blob/master/
   transfer_log.jcr).

Appendix A.  Other Potential Use Cases

A.1.  Escrow

   Although there is presently no requirement for the RIRs to escrow
   their registration data, the JSON data format described here could be
   used for that purpose in the future.

Appendix B.  Change History

   (Remove this section before publication.)

B.1.  Changes from 00 to 01

   *  A bulk data response is now a JSON Text Sequence of metadata JSON
      object and RDAP objects.
   *  Updated the metadata object definition to include the
      "rdapConformance", "versionId" (in lieu of "serial"), "producer",
      "productionDate", and "objectCount" fields.
   *  Each RDAP data object now has its own "rdapConformance" member to
      indicate the RDAP extensions used for its construction.
   *  Clarified requirements for the data objects to help clients
      consume bulk data consistently across all the RIRs.

Internet-Draft                  bulk-rdap                       May 2024


   *  No more mention of FTP since the HTTPS scheme is now a must for
      the Bulk RDAP.
   *  Can now get bulk data for all the RDAP object classes an RIR
      supports.
   *  Clarified content type and encoding for the bulk data.
   *  Updated the Operational Considerations section for out-of-band JWK
      distribution and off-line, daily generation of bulk data.

Appendix C.  Questions

   (Remove this section before publication.)

   *  Should we add an "objectClasses" array of strings in metadata to
      inform clients about which RDAP object classes the bulk data is
      being returned for?  This may be redundant for a bulk data request
      by an object class but when a server returns data for all the
      objects classes it supports, this could be handy in pre-emptively
      informing clients about the data to follow.
